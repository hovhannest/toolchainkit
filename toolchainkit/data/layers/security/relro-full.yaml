# Security characteristics
characteristics:
  protection_type: GOT/PLT hardening
  relocation_time: load time (all relocations resolved at startup)
  got_protection: complete - GOT is read-only after relocation
  plt_protection: complete - no lazy binding
  recommended_for: production builds on Linux

# Conflicts
conflicts:
  - type: relro
    reason: Multiple RELRO modes are mutually exclusive

# Trade-offs
tradeoffs:
  pros:
    - Complete GOT protection against overwrites
    - Prevents GOT-based exploitation techniques
    - No runtime relocation vulnerabilities
  cons:
    - Slightly longer startup time (all symbols resolved at load)
    - Larger memory footprint during startup
    - No lazy symbol resolution

# Usage notes
notes: |
  Full RELRO (RELocation Read-Only) provides the highest level of GOT/PLT
  protection on Linux systems.

  How it works:
  - All dynamic relocations are resolved at program load time
  - GOT (Global Offset Table) is marked read-only after relocation
  - Prevents GOT overwrites that could redirect function calls

  Security benefits:
  - Protects against GOT overwrite attacks
  - Makes exploitation significantly harder
  - Standard in modern Linux distributions

  Performance considerations:
  - Adds 1-2% to startup time for large programs
  - No runtime performance impact
  - Recommended for all production builds unless startup time is critical
