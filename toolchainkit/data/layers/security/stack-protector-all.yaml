# Performance impact
performance_impact: moderate  # 5-15% overhead

# Security characteristics
characteristics:
  protection_scope: all functions regardless of stack usage
  false_positive_rate: low
  recommended_for: security-critical builds, development/testing
  compatibility: high - supported by GCC 4.1+ and Clang 3.0+

# Conflicts
conflicts:
  - type: stack_protector
    reason: Multiple stack protector levels are mutually exclusive

# Usage notes
notes: |
  Stack protector all provides maximum protection by adding stack canaries
  to ALL functions, regardless of their stack usage patterns.
  This provides the strongest protection but with noticeable performance overhead.
  Best suited for:
  - Security-critical applications
  - Development and testing phases
  - When maximum security is required and performance is secondary
